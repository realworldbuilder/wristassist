Voice Notes from Your Wrist

## Description
Record voice notes on your Apple Watch or iPhone and get instant transcriptions — all processed on-device, never uploaded to the cloud.

WristAssist makes capturing ideas effortless. Tap once on your Apple Watch to start recording, and your voice note is automatically sent to your iPhone for transcription. You can also record directly on your iPhone. Either way, your words become text in seconds.

## Notes for Review
WristAssist requires an Apple Watch paired with an iPhone to demonstrate the full watch-to-phone recording workflow. However, the app also supports recording directly on iPhone — you can test this without an Apple Watch by tapping the green microphone button in the bottom-right corner of the iPhone app.

On first launch, the app loads a local speech recognition model (WhisperKit). This may take a few seconds. Once loaded, recording and transcription work entirely offline with no network connection required.

No account, login, or special configuration is needed.
